# class instance

Using a [class](./class.md) object as the template for creation, a class instance is an independent object in memory whose behavior and initial data are defined according to that template.

After being [instantiated](./class-instantiation.md), each instance has its own [lifecycle](./lifecycle.md), independent from other instances.
