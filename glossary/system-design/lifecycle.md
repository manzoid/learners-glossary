# lifecycle

The lifecycle of something is how it proceeds from birth to death.

The lifecycle of an object in memory is how it:

* is created, 
* operates while it is alive, and 
* is destroyed (its memory released and reused).

The lifecycle of a feature is how it:

* is conceived as an idea,
* is planned and approved
* is implemented
* is verified
* is released
* is maintained
* is removed
