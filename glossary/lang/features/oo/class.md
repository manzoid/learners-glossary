# class (object-oriented programming)

A class is a fundamental type in [object-oriented programming](./paradigm-oop.md)

Classes are a mixture of data and [behavior](./class-behavior.md).

A class has at least one [constructor](./class-constructor.md) function, which defines how to create a new [instance](./class-instance.md) of that class.

A class can have a [parent class](./class-parent.md) from which it [inherits](./class-inheritance.md) data and behavior.

A class can implement an [interface](./class-interface.md), which mandates behavior.
