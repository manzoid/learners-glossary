# compilation

Compiling code means translating it from one programming language to another programming language.

The tool that does this is called a [compiler](./source-code-compiler.md).

The most fundamental programming language is [machine code](./lang-machine-code.md).

Usually when we talk about compiling code, we mean compiling a [higher-level] language to machine code.

All programming languages you have heard of, aside from machine language and [assembly language](./lang-assembly-language.md), are considered higher-level languages.

This includes, for example, Java, Python, Ruby, Dart, Lisp, Haskell, Rust, Go, C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Lua and every other language.
