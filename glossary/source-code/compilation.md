# compilation

Compiling code means translating it from one programming language to another programming language.

The tool that does this is called a [compiler](./compiler.md).

The most fundamental programming language is [machine code](../lang/langs/machine-language/machine-code.md).

Usually when we talk about compiling code, we mean compiling a [higher-level](../cog-sci/level-of-abstraction.md) language to machine code.

All programming languages you have heard of, aside from machine language and [assembly language](../lang/langs/assembly/assembly-language.md), are considered higher-level languages.

This includes, for example, Java, Python, Ruby, Dart, Lisp, Haskell, Rust, Go, C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Lua and every other language.
